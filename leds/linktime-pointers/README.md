# Blinky Leds (link-time & function pointers)

A single-instance module and dual targeting strategy

## Requirements

■ Follow the TDD technique

■ Follow the dual targeting strategy

■ It should make multiple LEDs concurrently blinking N times

■ The delay for the blinks can be set by the user

■ The max number of LEDs is 32 and the delay is a time between 10 and 1000ms

■ Use the function pointers and link-time faking techniques to test your code

## Compilation

■ To compile and run the test on your computer, run **run.sh**
